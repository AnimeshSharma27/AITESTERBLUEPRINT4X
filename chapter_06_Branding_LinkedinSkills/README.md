# Chapter 06: Branding and LinkedIn Skills

A Claude/Codex skill that turns any content seed into a publish-ready pack in
Pramod Dutta's Testing Academy voice. Drop in a title, a handful of rough
bullets, a screenshot, a URL, a thread, or a spoken brain dump. The skill
returns four files: a Medium article, a LinkedIn post, LinkedIn image prompts,
and a Medium cover prompt.

This is not a generic "write a post" prompt. It encodes the Hook / Story / Offer
spine, the word budgets, the banned phrases, the image specs, and the failure
modes observed in real sessions.

## What it produces

| File | Job |
| --- | --- |
| `pack-1-medium-article.md` | 2,500 to 3,200 word Medium draft, paste-ready Markdown |
| `pack-2-linkedin-post.md` | Hook ladder + 220 to 260 word post + first-comment blocks |
| `pack-3-linkedin-image-prompts.md` | Style C v2 tweet-screenshot cards (hook, mechanism, closer) |
| `pack-4-medium-image-prompt.md` | Style A 16:9 cyber infographic for the Medium cover |

If you ask for a single deliverable, it still ships as its own file. Deliverables
are never merged.

`files.zip` holds the same materials as a flat archive plus the `.skill` bundle.
The folder is the copy to install: `SKILL.md` reads
`references/brand-voice.md`, not a sibling file.

## Install the skill

Copy the folder only when the destination name is unused:

```bash
skill_source=chapter_06_Branding_LinkedinSkills/content-repurpose-pack
skill_destination="$HOME/.claude/skills/content-repurpose-pack"

if [ -e "$skill_destination" ]; then
  echo "Skill already exists; compare and back it up before an explicitly approved update."
  exit 1
fi

mkdir -p "$(dirname "$skill_destination")"
cp -R "$skill_source" "$skill_destination"
```

For Codex, point `skill_destination` at `$HOME/.codex/skills/content-repurpose-pack`
instead. Then invoke it by name, such as `$content-repurpose-pack`.

You can also drop `content-repurpose-pack.skill` into a client that accepts
packaged `.skill` files. It is a zip of the same folder.

## How a pack is produced

The skill runs in order. It re-reads the voice spec every time; an earlier draft
in the conversation does not substitute for it.

1. **Load the voice.** Read `brand-voice.md`, then the deliverable specs, then the
   worked example. Hard rule: no em dashes anywhere.
2. **Identify the seed.** Six shapes: bare title, bullets, screenshot, URL,
   thread/article, spoken brain dump. Each is handled differently.
3. **Reconcile the promised number.** If the title says "7 steps" and the bullets
   are 5, the title wins. Split compound bullets. Never pad with filler.
4. **Mine five things.** The transferable thesis, the framework, verbatim assets,
   numbers (owned vs verifiable vs source-only), and a discard pile of the
   original author's CTAs.
5. **Map to the voice.** Pick one of the 13 content threads, reuse a signature
   line if it fits, re-angle one example into QA/SDET, and find a receipt.
6. **Write the four files.** Templates live in `deliverable-specs.md`.
7. **Closing sweep.** Grep for em dashes and banned phrases, count words, then
   run the chai test, the BFSI CTO test, and the next-sprint test.

When you ask for a controversial hook, the skill does not refuse and does not
sanitize. It returns a graded ladder:

- **A. The prediction.** Aggressive claim, marked as a forecast, timing record
  admitted as imperfect.
- **B. The threat.** Closest to a hard deadline, highest reach, often fails the
  BFSI CTO test. Belongs on X more often than LinkedIn.
- **C. The receipt.** A story, not a claim. Recommended default for LinkedIn.

## Voice spine

Every LinkedIn post and every Medium article uses the same three beats. Only the
word budget changes.

| Beat | Job | LinkedIn | Medium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hook | Earn the expand. Create a gap. | 2 lines, 15 to 25 words | Title + bold subtitle + first 2 paragraphs |
| Story | Pay it off with one thing that happened | 120 to 160 words | 60 to 75% of the article |
| Offer | Convert attention into a next action | 40 to 60 words | Honest Caveats + Bottom Line + italic CTA |

LinkedIn total is 220 to 260 words. 280 is the hard ceiling. The usual miss is a
great Hook and Story with no Offer.

The Offer ladder is four tiers, one per post: a belief rule, a specific question,
a free asset (link in the first comment), or a product launch. Rotate. Six
straight course links burns the "senior colleague over chai" positioning.

## Worked example

The bundled example starts from a dictated title ("7 step formula") plus five
rough third-person bullets about moving from manual QA into automation.

What the skill did:

- Expanded 5 bullets to 7 by splitting compound items (exercises vs projects,
  GitHub vs LinkedIn). Nothing invented.
- Converted third person to second person. Kept every number: 90 days, 300 to
  400 exercises, 10 a day, 1 hour, 5 projects.
- Pulled the real thesis out of a closing aside: coding fear is cured by
  repetition volume, not by understanding.
- Built a receipt the seed did not contain (four interviews dying at "send us
  your GitHub") and flagged anonymization in the verify block.
- Recommended hook C, assigned hook B to X, and reported a 292-to-270 word cut.

That gap between the input and the output is the gap the skill exists to close.

## Q&A

- **Q: When do I reach for it?** A: Any time you have a seed (even a bare
  headline) and want a Medium + LinkedIn + image pack in this voice, not a
  generic rewrite.
- **Q: What does it replace?** A: Re-prompting from scratch for voice, length,
  image specs, and first-comment splits. Those rules already live in the skill.
- **Q: What's the gotcha?** A: A pack with no receipt is the biggest quality
  drop. If the seed has no real story, supply one or accept a composite flagged
  for anonymization. Also grep for em dashes before publishing; they sneak in.

## Trigger phrases

The skill is meant to fire on "write a LinkedIn post", "make a Medium article",
"repurpose this", "in my voice", "full pack", "give me hooks", and also when you
simply drop source material or a title with steps and expect content back.
It triggers even when only one deliverable is requested.
